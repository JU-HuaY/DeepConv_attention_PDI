# DeepConv_attention_PDI
The project contains three parts:datasets, code for processing data, deeplearning model.

The dataset contains four public datasets:Human,C.elegans,BindingDB and Kinase. these datasets are stored in files(.txt).

Your can use the file "data_pre.py" to process this datasets for our deeplearning model.

We provide four models accroding to these datasets.

Please note that this code need the following envirment:

We suggest you could use anaconda as an operating environment.

Special library:

Tensorflow 1.14
Keras 2.25
Rdkit
